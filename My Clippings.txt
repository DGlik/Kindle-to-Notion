retire in order to “find themselves,” as we might put it. In the Renaissance, as in ancient Rome, it was part of the well-managed life. You had your period of civic business, then you withdrew to discover what life was really about and to begin the long process of preparing for death. Montaigne developed reservations about the second part of this, but there is no doubt about his interest in contemplating life. He wrote: “Let us cut loose from all the ties that bind us to others; let us win from ourselves the power to live really alone and to live that way at our ease.” Seneca,

Seneca, in advising retirement, had also warned of dangers. In a dialogue called “On Tranquillity of Mind,” he wrote that idleness and isolation could bring to the fore all the consequences of having lived life in the wrong way, consequences that people usually avoided by keeping busy—that is, by continuing to live life in the wrong way. The symptoms could include dissatisfaction, self-loathing, fear, indecisiveness, lethargy, and melancholy. Giving up work brings out spiritual ills, especially if one then gets the habit of reading too many books—or, worse, laying out the books for show and gloating over the view.

There was nothing easy about this new hobby of his. Montaigne liked to pretend that he threw the Essays together carelessly, but occasionally he forgot the pose and admitted what hard work it was: It is a thorny undertaking, and more so than it seems, to follow a movement so wandering as that of our mind, to penetrate the opaque depths of its innermost folds, to pick out and immobilize the innumerable flutterings that agitate it.

Thus, most of Montaigne’s thought consists of a series of realizations that life is not as simple as he has just made it out to be. If my mind could gain a firm footing, I would not make essays, I would make decisions; but it is always in apprenticeship and on trial.

In December 1560, in a speech expressing a feeling widespread at the time, the chancellor Michel de L’Hôpital said, “It is folly to hope for peace, repose, and friendship among people of different faiths.” Even if desirable, it would be an impossible ideal. The only path to political unity was religious unity. As a Spanish theologian remarked, no republic could be well governed if “everyone considers his own God to be the only true God … and everyone else to be blind and deluded.” Most Catholics would have considered this too self-evident to be worth mentioning. Even Protestants tended to impose unity whenever they got their own state to manage. Un roi, une foi, une loi, went the saying: one king, one faith, one law. Hatred of anyone who ventured to suggest a middle ground was practically the only thing on which everyone else could agree.

The subject of Voluntary Servitude is the ease with which, throughout history, tyrants have dominated the masses, even though their power would evaporate instantly if those masses withdrew their support. There is no need for a revolution: the people need only stop cooperating, and supplying armies of slaves and sycophants to prop the tyrant up. Yet this almost never happens, even to those who maltreat their subjects monstrously. The more they starve and neglect their people, the more the people seem to love them. The Romans mourned Nero when he died, despite his abuses. The same happened on the death of Julius Caesar—whom, unusually, La Boétie does not admire. (Montaigne had similar reservations.) Here was an emperor “who abolished the laws and liberty, a personage in whom there was, it seems to me, nothing of value,” yet he was adored out of all measure. The mystery of tyrannical dominance is as profound as that of love itself.

La Boétie believes that tyrants somehow hypnotize their people—though this term had not yet been invented. To put it another way, they fall in love with him. They lose their will in his. It is a terrible spectacle to see “a million men serving miserably with their necks under the yoke, not constrained by a greater force, but somehow (it seems) enchanted and charmed by the mere mention of the name of one, whose power they should not fear, since he is alone, and whose qualities they should not love, since he is savage and inhuman towards them.”

La Boétie’s analysis of political power comes very close to Montaigne’s sense of mystery about La Boétie himself: “Because it was he, because it was I.” That a tyrant’s charisma can work like a spell or a love potion has been made apparent by a series of autocrats in our own recent history. When one henchman of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin was asked in an interview why he had loved his leader so loyally, he replied in a way that sounds just like Montaigne talking about La Boétie, or Alcibiades about Socrates: You see, love, something called love: you will find a man loving a woman who’s one-eyed. If you ask that man, why do you love that ugly woman, do you think that person will tell you? The secret behind that thing is between two. What made me to love him and what also made him to love me.

The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win” whatever game is being played. This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking.

The Epicurean writer Lucretius suggested picturing yourself at the point of death, and considering two possibilities. Either you have lived well, in which case you can go your way satisfied, like a well-fed guest leaving a party. Or you have not, but then it makes no difference that you are losing your life, since you obviously did not know what to do with it anyway.

And even he then believed, and still believes, in part of its program and practice, “the democratic part.” The other nine, decent, hard-working, ordinarily intelligent and honest men, did not know before 1933 that Nazism was evil. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil. And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.

Old Karl-Heinz Schwenke was a product of “the golden time” before the first World War. Even in the golden time he had, as he said, “only been a tailor.” “But I had ten suits of my own when I married,” said the iron-faced old dandy. “Twenty-five years later, when their ‘democracies’ got through with me in 1918, I had none, not one. I had my sweater and my pants. Even my Army uniform was worn out. My medals were sold. I was nothing. Then, suddenly, I was needed. National Socialism had a place for me. I was nothing—and then I was needed.” “And now,” I said, “you are down to your sweater and pants again.” “Yes,” he said, “now that their ‘democracies’ are through with me again.” “National Socialism,” I said, gently, “didn’t leave its enemies that much.” “They had it coming. You see what their ‘democracies’ did to us.” By “they” Herr Schwenke always meant the Jews. He was the most primitive of my ten friends. He was a very limited man. Facts, although he could apprehend them, had no use he could put them to; he could neither retain nor relate them. He could talk, but he could not listen. I let him talk.

They control the government, money, everything, everywhere.” I wanted to tell him a story, but I didn’t. It’s a story about a Jew riding in a streetcar, in Germany during the Third Reich, reading Hitler’s paper, the Völkische Beobachter. A non-Jewish acquaintance sits down next to him and says, “Why do you read the Beobachter?” “Look,” says the Jew, “I work in a factory all day. When I get home, my wife nags me, the children are sick, and there’s no money for food. What should I do on my way home, read the Jewish newspaper? ‘Pogrom in Roumania.’ ‘Jews Murdered in Poland.’ ‘New Laws against Jews.’ No, sir, a half-hour a day, on the streetcar, I read the Beobachter. ‘Jews the World Capitalists.’ ‘Jews Control Russia.’ ‘Jews Rule in England.’ That’s me they’re talking about. A half-hour a day I’m somebody. Leave me alone, friend.”

Being a German may make whining easier, but not inevitable. In October, 1945, the Confessional church of Germany, the “church within the Church” which had defied Hitler’s “German Christians,” issued the “Stuttgart Confession”: “We know ourselves to be with our people in a great company of suffering, but also in a great solidarity of guilt. With great pain do we say that through us has endless suffering been brought to many peoples and countries. That to which we have often borne witness before our congregations, we declare in the name of the whole church. True, we have struggled for many years in the name of Jesus Christ against a spirit which has found its terrible expression in the National Socialist regime of violence, but we accuse ourselves for not witnessing more courageously….” Those, too, were German words.

Intervening events have driven from all but the hardiest memories the disaster of June 14, 1907, the day that the entire Temperate Zone was hit head on by the worst heat wave in history. Although the suffering of streetcar passengers generally was noted in the chronicles of the disaster, one of the most singular incidents (or congeries of incidents) of that singular day was, so far as I know, never reported. The press had, understandably, overlooked the fact that in those days, and on that day, June 14, the streetcars everywhere in the world carried placards which read: “Windows Are NOT To Be Opened before June 15.” In downtown Milan, where the cars round the Duomo, an Italian threw a rock through a streetcar window and ran. In Barcelona a Spaniard fell asleep and rode to the end of the line. In Leeds an English rider called the attention of the Yorkshire Post to the situation, in a strong letter, and, after the letter was picked up in the Times, a Parliamentary debate ensued and the Liberal Government fell—ostensibly on the issue of window regulation. In Graz the streetcar windows were in such bad condition that, although they were closed, the breeze came through and no Austrian suffocated. The Bucharest Surface Lines were sold to a Turkish syndicate reliably reported to represent the interests of the Government of –––. In Lyon a tram passenger cried “Liberté!” and drove his fist through the window. At the sight of his bleeding hand, the Lyonnaise in the dreamy, picturesque Place de Ville rioted. The Swiss Cabinet, in an emergency session, ordered fans installed at once on all the municipal railways. In the Scandinavian capitals it was cool, even muggy. In Omaha an American opened the streetcar window. In Hannover a German, having read the placard and consulted his mechanical pocket calendar, sat back comfortably in his seat, kept his coat on, and read his paper; but that evening he beat his small son, who, twenty years later, joined the NSDAP, or National Socialist German Workers, Party.

Being beset, in fancy and in reality, has produced in the Jews and in the German nation the compensatory assertion of superiority and messianism. Each of them must save the world; so only, saving the world, are Germany and the Jew to be saved. But neither is evangelistic. Conversion (which implies humility) and love (which implies submission) have no place in either’s mission. The remaining alternative is mastery; mastery, of course, for the sake of the mastered. In the Germans the necessary means of mastery, imposed upon the benefactors by the intransigence of the prospective beneficiaries, were lately seen to be genocide. But genocide was not unknown, once, to the Jews, and, if survival requires excessive measures, the salvation of the whole world ennobles their use.

Freedom is nothing but the habit of choice. Now choice is remarkably wide in this life. Each day begins with the choice of tying one’s left or right shoelace first, and ends with the choice of observing or ignoring the providence of God. Pressure narrows choice forcibly. Under light pressure men sacrifice small choices lightly. But it is only under the greatest pressure that they sacrifice the greatest choices, because choice, and choice alone, informs them that they are men and not machines.

The gas ovens of Belsen were peculiarly German; the improvised slaughter pits of the Ukraine were Nazi. The distinction is a large one. Nazism, like the Lutheran Reformation and all other German upheavals, contained revolutionary elements of improvisation. But Nazism was always at war with the Army. The Army was German. The remarkable fact of the Putsch against Hitler of July 20, 1944, is that a handful of Army officers could be found to undertake it; that it was planned so recklessly; that it happened at all, not that it failed or might have succeeded. It was treated as treason. What it was was un-German. What was truly German was what has come to be called the cold pogrom, the systematic persecution, legal, methodical, and precisely co-ordinated, of the “national enemies.” When you have combined “cold” with “pogrom“—they appear to be uncombinable—you have Nazi Germany, the organism as a whole gone wild, its organs admirably coordinated.

Subjects’ unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular. This is a profoundly important conclusion. People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling their friends about what they have heard, but this does not mean that their understanding of the world has really changed. The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact. There is a deep gap between our thinking about statistics and our thinking about individual cases.

I suspect that he felt from the first day onwards all these things were part of life’s trials and tribulations, that we could master it all by doing the right thing, by focusing on the here and now, and by disregarding the past. That, in my view, is the essence of Kloppo. He was convincing because he was convinced.

“We won’t give up, we’ll pick ourselves up again from the floor.” No one had really looked at us before. But now we were Mainz 05.’ The dwarf-sized club who wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer, the serial losers who yelled ‘yes’ into fate’s ugly face. ‘That was only possible because of the special relationship between Klopp and his players. To this day, no one feels indifferent about playing for us. Players love playing here and those who played here ten years ago love coming back.’

‘The experience,’ he added, ‘is more important than the result. We play Erlebnisfußball [football that provides an experience], exactly the kind of football that I want to watch. We want to run incessantly. That’s our code of arms. We are the vanguard of the regular guys in the pub. They want us to run and fight. Our entry ticket is well-defined, week after week: passion, willingness to run, will. If one guy leaves the stadium thinking, “they should have run and fought more today”, we got it wrong completely. I love this game because it’s about power, because it stirs up the dust. You can only get in touch with the game’s emotionality via pace and action. A win alone is never emotional. A good game makes the hairs at the back of your neck stand up until Monday or Tuesday. Football is theatre. If we don’t put on a superb performance, only two guys will be sitting there at the end.’

The Mainz players were also shown a documentary on the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team. Klopp asked his men how they felt about calling themselves the All Reds. Would they feel embarrassed? Or could they put on the 05 shirt and vow to themselves that they would push to the very limits as long they wore it? Mainz never performed the haka in the changing room. But Maori chants were played on the team bus stereo driving into stadiums.

‘To toil day and night is a big part of being Swabian,’ says Schlauch. ‘That has its roots in history, as has the Swabians’ reputation for being innovative. In other regions, the first-born would inherit their parents’ farms. But in Swabia, the land was partitioned equitably among the children. The farmland got smaller and smaller until it was no longer viable, so the descendants were forced to take up other jobs. Many of them became inventors and Tüftler, people looking to find new solutions to old problems.’

Instances of participants’ avoidance of the Take-Home Exercise provide a stimulus to the therapist to reiterate, as appropriate, to the group as a whole the demonstrated value of the Take-Home Exercise for progress in the treatment program. The therapist should encourage participants to at least try the exercise, or do a part of it, on the premise that completing even a small part is “a thousand times better” than doing none at all. The therapist should also warn participants against succumbing to the temptation, born of shame, to skip the session if they have not completed the Take-Home Exercise

features of the ADHD skeptic, but has built a stronger bulwark of defenses. Patients who continue to question the diagnosis often harbor the belief that they should be able to complete tasks, focus, maintain organization, and so forth. This belief is typically rooted in childhood experiences with parents who may have been overly moralistic or judgmental and who failed to recognize that the patient’s diffculties in childhood were manifestations of a condition over which the child lacked full control. The persistence of this belief into adulthood allows the patient to continue to believe in his or her essential complete self-control and potential perfectibility. The belief often masks underlying feelings of incompetence and fears of failure should he or she attempt to change and not succeed
